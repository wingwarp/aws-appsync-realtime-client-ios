> [!IMPORTANT]
> AWS AppSync Realtime Client iOS is not intended to be used directly; it is used as a dependency of [Amplify Swift](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-swift) and [AWS AppSync SDK iOS](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-ios). If you have any issues stemming from the library, please open an issue in the applicable repository for the product that youâ€™re using directly.
